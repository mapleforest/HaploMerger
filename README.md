# HaploMerger

HaploMerger is a toolkit designed to facilitate the analysis of a highly polymorphic genome sequence. It consists of a collection of Perl and C programs extracted from a more inclusive genome assembly and annotation pipeline.

The standalone package of HaploMerger is a fully automated pipeline used to reconstruct allelic relationships in a polymorphic diploid assembly and to reconstruct reference haploid assemblies.
